// The views that show time (the spectrogram, the history and the loudness) share one timeline,
// so that the same moment is in the same place in all of them, whichever was showing when it
// happened. Time is cut into slots. One clock counts the slots, every view records something for
// every slot, whether it is showing or not, and every view shows the same span of time.
//
// A view keeps what it records as data rather than as pixels, so its picture can be made again
// when the window is resized or the span is changed, without losing anything.
